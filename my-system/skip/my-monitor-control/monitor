Install ddcutil package to manage monitor settings. Generally speaking, any settings that
can be changed by pressing buttons on the monitor canm be modified by ddcutil.

requires ddcutil package and i2c-dev kernel module. pacman installs i2c-tools as a 
dependency for ddcutil.

create file /etc/modules-load.d/i2c-dev.conf with only the following text "i2c-dev" to 
load the kernel module on boot. 
permission for using the /dev/i2c-* devices can be granted by adding the user to the
i2c user group.

ddcutil has several useful subcommands. The general way to use ddcutil is:
ddcutil command [address monitor] [arguments]

There are multiple methods to address your montitor. the most useful are --display and --bus.
--bus is the fastest. You can find your monitor info by using 'ddcutil detect' command.

You dont neet to address the monitor when only one monitor is connected. 

usefull ddcutil commands:
ddcutil detect
	-Show general information on the connected displays.
ddcutil capabilities
	-Queries which display features can get/set for a given monitor.
	 Shows a list starting with commmands and their code. These are the commands supported
	 by the monitor. These are the commands we use with the ddcutil utility.
	 The VCP Features have a code which you can address using the getvcp and setvcp commands.
	 The feature description in this list are the standard descriptions they might not 
	 exactly correspond to the actual monitor values. 
	 An example for this is the feature group DC on my Asus Proart monitor. The DC group
	 consists of 9 values 00 should be Standard/Default mode but all other modes are 
	 reported as 'Unrecognized value'. This does not mean they dont work. ddcutil just 
	 does not know what label/name these values have in the monitor.
	 value 0b for instance represents 'Scenery Mode' in the ProArt OSD presets.
ddcutil vcpinfo --verbose (feature-code-or-group)
	-Shows general information and description regarding the given feature code.
ddcutil getvcp <feature-code-or-group>
	-Report VCP featue values set in the given monitor.
ddcutil setvcp <feature-code-or-group> [+|-] <new-value>
	-Set the vcp featue value. for instance to turn of the monitor us the following command
	 'ddcutil setvcp D6 05'.

Useful feature codes for the Asus Proart monitor:

Feature: 60 (Input Source)
	Values:
	03: DVI-1
	11: HDMI-1
	0f: DisplayPort-1
	10: DisplayPort-2

Feature: D6 (Power mode)
	Values:
	01: DPM: On,  DPMS: Off   (this turns the monitor on)
	04: DPM: Off, DPMS: Off   (this sets the monitor to stand-by)
	05: Write only value to turn off display 
	
Feature: DC (Display Mode)
	Values:
	0x0b: ProArt Preset: Scenery Mode (Mostly the same as sRGB mode exept full brightness)
	0x0d: ProArt Preset: sRGB mode (Factory calibrated accurate color mode)
	0x18: ProArt Preset: Darkroom mode (The same as sRGB but minimal brightness)

ddcutil capabilities reports (abbreviated) two digit feature values. These all work with 
setvcp, the display mode values however require you to use the entire four digit code.
